## LOCAL SCHEDULE PW 13 TAC §7.125(b)(2)

(Second Edition)

RETENTION SCHEDULE FOR RECORDS OF PUBLIC WORKS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT SERVICES

This schedule establishes mandatory minimum retention periods for records that are associated with public works and other government services. No local government office may dispose of a record listed in this schedule prior to the expiration of its retention period. A records control schedule of a local government may not set a retention period that is less than that established for the record in this schedule. Original paper records may be disposed of prior to the expiration of their minimum retention periods if they have been microfilmed or electronically stored pursuant to the provisions of the

Local Government Code, Chapter 204 or Chapter 205, as applicable, and rules of the Texas State Library and Archives Commission adopted under

those chapters. Actual disposal of such records by a local government is subject to the policies and procedures of its records management program.

Destruction of local government records contrary to the provisions of the Local Government Records Act of 1989 and administrative rules adopted it,

including this schedule, is a Class A misdemeanor and, under certain circumstances, a third degree felony (Penal Code, Section 37.10). Anyone

destroying local government records without legal authorization may also be subject to criminal penalties and fines under the Public Information Act

(Government Code, Chapter 552).

**INTRODUCTION**

The Government Code, Section 441.158, provides that the Texas State Library and Archives Commission shall issue records retention schedules for

each type of local government, including a schedule for records common to all types of local government. The law provides further that each schedule

must state the retention period prescribed by federal or state law, rule of court, or regulation for a record for which a period is prescribed; and prescribe

retention periods for all other records, which periods have the same effect as if prescribed by law after the records retention schedule is adopted as a rule

of the Commission.

The retention period for a record applies to the record regardless of the medium in which it is maintained. Some records listed in this schedule are

maintained electronically in many offices, but electronically stored data used to create in any manner a record or the functional equivalent of a record as

described in this schedule must be retained, along with the hardware and software necessary to access the data, for the retention period assigned to the

record, unless backup copies of the data generated from electronic storage are retained in paper or on microfilm for the retention period. This includes

electronic mail (e-mail), websites, and electronic publications.

Unless otherwise stated, the retention period for a record is in calendar years from the date of its creation. The retention period applies only to an official

record as distinct from convenience or working copies created for informational purposes. Where several copies are maintained, each local government

should decide which shall be the official record and in which of its divisions or departments it will be maintained. Local governments in their records

management programs should establish policies and procedures to provide for the systematic disposal of copies.

If a record described in this schedule is maintained in a bound volume of a type in which pages were not meant to be removed, the retention period,

unless otherwise stated, dates from the date of last entry.

If two or more records listed in this schedule is maintained together by a local government and are not severable, the combined record must be

retained for the length of time of the component with the longest retention period. A record whose minimum retention period on this schedule has not

yet expired and is **less than permanent** may be disposed of if it has been so badly damaged by fire, water, or insect or rodent infestation as to render it

unreadable, or if portions of the information in the record have been so thoroughly destroyed that remaining portions are unintelligible. If the retention

period for the record is **permanent** in this schedule, authority to dispose of the damaged record must be obtained from the Director and Librarian of

the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. A Request for Authority to Destroy Unscheduled Records (Form SLR 501) should be used for this

purpose.

Certain records listed in this schedule are assigned the retention period of AV (as long as administratively valuable). This retention period affords local

governments the maximum amount of discretion in determining a specific retention period for the record described.


**Use of Asterisk (*)**

The use of an asterisk in this second edition of Local Schedule PW i ndicates that the record is either new to this edition, the retention period for the

record has been changed, or substantive amendments have been made to the description or remarks concerning the record. An asterisk is not used to

indicate minor amendments to grammar or punctuation.

**ABBREVIATIONS USED IN THIS SCHEDULE**

CE - Calendar year end
